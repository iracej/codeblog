    <p>This one was pretty easy, which considering it's the first assignment seems appropriate. The most
      challenging aspect so far was figuring out how to make the picture of myself not immense, and all that took was a quick Google search.<br>
      I learned about the src attribute, and in general just how to do basic HTML. I didn't already know much, and what I did know was from lectures.<br>
      Most of the specific stuff I pulled out for this, stuff like 'how do I specify the title again?',
      I got from the lecture notes. The info I needed for the src thing I got from the w3schools page on HTML images.</p><br>

    <h1><a href=http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~iracej/assignment-2-iracej/>Assignment Two</a> Reflection</h1>
    <p>Less easy. There were a good few times when I tried to do something and it just didn't work-
      for example, I never was able to figure out how to get rid of the link styling from the Tweeter logo-
      and figuring out how to position the 'create twit' button was harder than it probably should have been.
      That said, it wasn't all terrible. Once I had some practice working with flex boxes they weren't a problem
      at all, and the hardest part of getting buttons to change color when I hovered over them was figuring out
      what the hex value I needed was.<br>
      If I had an extra two weeks and sufficient motivation for the project, I'd want to figure out why the
      title and navbar weren't flush with the edge of the window. I manually set their padding and margin to
      0, and that did make a difference, but it didn't fix it and I have no idea why. Another thing, I'd want
      to make the magnifying glass icon by the search bar and the megaphone icon in the 'make twit' button
      larger. I tried setting the height and width properties, but that just made the boxes they were in bigger.
      Fixing those problems probably wouldn't take that long, but to be honest I'm kind of out of patience for
      this project and I'm willing to call it close enough.</p><br>
