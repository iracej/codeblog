    <h1><a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~iracej/assignment-1-iracej/">Assignment One</a> Reflection</h1>
    <p>This one was pretty easy, which considering it's the first assignment seems appropriate. The most
      challenging aspect so far was figuring out how to make the picture of myself not immense, and all that took was a quick Google search.<br>
      I learned about the src attribute, and in general just how to do basic HTML. I didn't already know much, and what I did know was from lectures.<br>
      Most of the specific stuff I pulled out for this, stuff like 'how do I specify the title again?',
      I got from the lecture notes. The info I needed for the src thing I got from the w3schools page on HTML images.</p><br>

    <h1><a href=http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~iracej/assignment-2-iracej/>Assignment Two</a> Reflection</h1>
    <p>Less easy. There were a good few times when I tried to do something and it just didn't work-
      for example, I never was able to figure out how to get rid of the link styling from the Tweeter logo-
      and figuring out how to position the 'create twit' button was harder than it probably should have been.
      That said, it wasn't all terrible. Once I had some practice working with flex boxes they weren't a problem
      at all, and the hardest part of getting buttons to change color when I hovered over them was figuring out
      what the hex value I needed was.<br>
      If I had an extra two weeks and sufficient motivation for the project, I'd want to figure out why the
      title and navbar weren't flush with the edge of the window. I manually set their padding and margin to
      0, and that did make a difference, but it didn't fix it and I have no idea why. Another thing, I'd want
      to make the magnifying glass icon by the search bar and the megaphone icon in the 'make twit' button
      larger. I tried setting the height and width properties, but that just made the boxes they were in bigger.
      Fixing those problems probably wouldn't take that long, but to be honest I'm kind of out of patience for
      this project and I'm willing to call it close enough.</p><br>

    <h1>Assignment Three Reflection</h1>
    <p>Turns out I don't have to actually publish the assignments, that was just an assignment one thing, so no link
      this time. I left starting on this assignment way longer than I should have, and it caused me a good bit of
      stress, but once I sat down and started actually working on it it wasn't all that hard. The hardest part, for
      me, was getting the search function working. It took me a while to figure out how to get the JavaScript to
      think about the actual text in the Twits- at first, I tried comparing the divs containing twit-text and
      twit-author to the search, then I tried twit-text.value which just gave me undefined, but eventually after
      some Googling I found the .textContent property, and that was exactly what I needed. Beyond that, the only
      part that gave me trouble after I got rolling was getting the little bullhorn thing to show up in new Twits.
      When I looked at the HTML, I could see it had the 'fas fa-bullhorn' class. It took me a while to get to adding
      the 'fas' and 'fa-bullhorn' classes seperately- newTwitIcon.classList.add('fas fa-bullhorn') and .add('fas.fa-bullhorn')
      didn't work- but I got there. Otherwise, this all went more or less smoothly.</p><br>

    <h1> Assignment Four Reflection</h1>
    <p>This one wasn't much of a problem for me either. I had to look some stuff up- the lecture notes weren't completely
      exhaustive about everything I needed, and the official nodeJS documentation is a little, uh, opaque- but I figured
      most of it out. The biggest roadblock I ran into was declaring the content type, since I didn't realize that you have
      to use different content types for different types of stuff. In hindsight, obviously telling the computer
      that this JavaScript is of the content type 'text/html' isn't gonna get you what you want, but at the time I clearly
      didn't think it through.<br>
      With regard to resources that helped me to get this done, I owe Shaurya my life. Absolutely no way I would have ever
      figured out the content type thing without him. I looked it up, I didn't find any helpful details about arguments for
      response.setHeader(), and he helped me point out a bunch of other obvious, stupid mistakes that would have taken me
      forever to figure out on my own. Extreme respect for that man.</p><br>
